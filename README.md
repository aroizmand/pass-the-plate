## Overview

Our application is uniquely designed to address the pressing issues of food waste and the lack of access to free, healthy food options for those in need. By focusing on a sustainable way of living, we've created a platform where individuals can effortlessly access and provide free homemade meals and non-perishable goods. Users can seamlessly filter by preferences, dietary restrictions, and proximity through a variety of user-friendly interfaces. Among these are a distance filtering map and integrated messaging services, ensuring that both givers and receivers can easily communicate and coordinate.
